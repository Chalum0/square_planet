# square_planet

Square planet is a python project of an open world space game where planets are cubic.
The engine is made 100% out of pygame and does not use opengl. It only runs on the cpu.



# !! High end computer required !!

The project runs well on my computer (my cpu is a ryzen 5 4600H).
The better your cpu, the better perfomances you'll have.



# Open source

Everyone has access to the code and can modify it but please don't sell any modified version.
The code might not be available and open source forever as we might decide to sell the game.

The code was made but Snappyink A.K.A. Chalumo with the help of, for the logic part,
[maDU59_](https://www.youtube.com/@maDU59_). Thanks to him.
